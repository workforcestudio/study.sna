PAGE 3","Key Concept               1   What is Organization  Development & Change?      “You must be the change you wish to see in the world.”                                                        - Mahatma Gandhi  The ability to manage change is becoming the most important skill for workers and managers in the future. To quote Mahatma Gandhi, ‘You must be the change you wish to see in the world.’ That means that leaders, managers, and workers of the future must be capable of serving as outstanding role models of what they wish to see the world be and become.  What is Organization Development (OD)?  First, let us start by explaining that Organization Development (OD) is all about a humanistic approach to changing organizations. It is a bottoms- up vs. top-down approach. To put it a different way, consider that the traditional top-down organizational structure is where many employees’ goals are often to please the boss.                                                                                                                  PAGE 4","Figure 1.1. Traditional top-down organizational structure  Consider now if we flipped our approach and placed the customer on top and structured our organizations so that work groups were empowered to think innovatively about how to better serve customers and improve processes. This is the focus of Organization Development (OD). Organization Development (OD) is a “bottoms-up” facilitative approach but Organizational Development is a “top- down” directive approach.             Figure 1.2. Bottoms-up Organization Development (OD) approach                                                                                                                  PAGE 5","How is Organization Development (OD) defined?  Organization Development (OD) is a change effort that is carried out in a participative way, involving those affected by the change, and that uses action research as a key roadmap for the change. While OD change efforts can be focused on individuals, most OD efforts are geared to changing groups or entire organizations. (Rothwell, 2014) Here are FOUR main characteristics of OD adapted from Dr. William J. Rothwell (2014):         OD focuses on group change.  It thus differs from other change efforts, like training, that are directed toward changing individuals. Like training, however, OD seeks to bring about change by equipping people with new knowledge, skills and attitudes. Unlike training, however, OD often seeks to create a new organizational culture. Culture can be understood to mean the often taken-for-granted expectations of people in organizations about the right way to do things. Training is seldom able to change culture because it brings about change one-person-at-a-time, which does not create a critical mass (a sufficient number of people at one time) for change in the same way that OD efforts are intended to do.                                                                                                                  PAGE 6","OD usually focuses on long-term change.  It thus differs from training, which seeks short-term change by giving people new knowledge and skills that they can apply immediately on their jobs. Unlike training, however, OD focuses on changing groups or organizations. Since groups and organizations simply take longer to change than individuals do, OD efforts are often necessarily long-term. Some authorities have estimated, for instance, that, to install a large-scale change in a major corporation, timeframes of 4-6 years should not be considered unusual. Generally speaking, the larger the group or organization that is to undergo the change and the more radical the change effort, the longer it will take.         OD often relies on assistance from external or internal        OD consultants.  An OD consultant, individuals from outside or inside the immediate area in which the change is to occur and whose role is to facilitate, rather than direct, the change effort. An OD consultant may, for instance, be hired from outside the organization. Alternatively, an internal consultant may be brought into the setting from another division--such as the HRD department or the HR department. OD consultants who do work in OD have a special name and are called change agents because they are agents of change.         OD is inherently participative in nature.  Individuals in the group or organization needing change are involved in all phases of the change process. Often they define and frame the problems calling for change, reach agreement on the problems, define and frame the solutions that can be implemented to solve the problems, devise their own action plan for installing the change, take active roles in the installation effort, and play a major role in evaluating results.                                                                                                                  PAGE 7","OD Effectiveness ModelTM      The Penn State Organization Development (OD) Effectiveness Model’s     approach entails three stages: (a) building on experience, (b) using     constructive feedback, and (c) learning from other disciplines, particularly     innovation diffusion research. The OD Effectiveness model as shown below in     Figure 2.1 considers other aspects of existing models for more effective     organization development and change.

PAGE 8","This model stresses an individual approach to change and the importance of interpersonal and technological communication networks. Many models of change focus on a normative/reeducative approach to behavioral changes on the part of individuals when people are driven by self-interest (Duck, 2001). These models imply authority-driven, top-down approaches when managing change for persons wanting reliable communications in making independent and voluntary change decisions (Smollan, 2013; Zhou, 2008). This new model complements current change models by stressing the importance of the change process for both the individual and the organization.         1st Phase: Inquiring  Organizations and individuals are always changing as they pursue a better future. Previous change models have relied primarily on one of two approaches to understanding the present: (a) assessing data that represent value-neutral reality and (b) being involved in communication that reveals an individual’s notion of reality. Being aware that objective/subjective goals, capabilities, and cultures coexist in an organization, one needs to consider the present by using the two approaches simultaneously and interpreted from perspectives of both initiators and adopters of change. To emphasize once more, there is no “one best way” to manage change. Unless an organization is entirely dysfunctional, all issues and opportunities identified from the appraisal must be considered. Before developing an effective strategy, one must assess an organization’s communication practice and overall structure. A comprehensive understanding of how decisions are made as well as the structure of formal/informal communication networks and information technology systems is vital for developing effective strategies for any future changes. Success depends on one’s approach.                                                                                                                  PAGE 9","2nd Phase: Strategizing  You must not be misled by thinking the future is something concrete. Instead, the future is always changing. You must keep this point in mind and always be ready to redefine and adjust your expectations. You must consider the aspects of each option and how it may apply to target groups and individuals, their overall readiness to change, and the organizational communication network. You should also maintain the level of commitment on the part of top leaders, as they are the primary instigators of change and must be aware that change must happen at all levels. It is best to consider different change options with potential benefits and costs. These include those with potential crises, plausible possibilities, and the expected communication patterns and responses among the target audience. Doing this is particularly important for making sound decisions regarding any changes that are to be made.         3rd Phase: Planning  Besides planning the time frame and resources, a communication scheme must be designed with two core components: (a) framing messages so that people will be more aware of certain aspects of the scope of the changes and (b) establishing communication networks to engage messengers and technologies in communicating the initiative effectively. For example, information and messages need to be understandable, advantageous, and compatible; executives, middle managers, opinion leaders, target individuals, and even potential resisters, along with communication technologies, need a proper role. Communication should also be assessed throughout the change process.                                                                                                                  PAGE 10","For any undesirable consequences, such as organizational instability and members being averse to change, discussion must follow to deal with these problems. Although it is impossible, of course, to anticipate all the possibilities, feedback systems must be in place. These will stimulate communication and lead to any adjustments that need to be made along with providing for general evaluation after changes are made.         4th Phase: Doing  Knowledge should be shared to help targeted groups stay informed and interested in the proposed change (Rogers, 2003). The capacity, effectiveness, and efficiency of communication technologies should be used to inform people, and communicators should do their best to influence them. Opinion leaders must be actively involved because they can influence people. Knowing is one thing. Doing is another. Once the change is accepted by the early adopters, a wider audience will likely be receptive (Centola, 2013) by interaction through communication networks, opinion leaders, and others. The change initiative continues to develop similar to but possibly different from what was originally planned. Change leaders must maintain the momentum and anticipate outcomes, always being flexible and creative rather than necessarily maintaining predetermined details. Any negative feedback must be monitored and discussed fully because a poorly managed process may cause not only the initiative but also the organization to fail.                                                                                                                  PAGE 11","5th Phase: Revitalizing  After accepting change, living systems keep adjusting as necessary to confirm or revoke it and even revitalize the change to open the way for additional changes. Three major components are involved at this stage: (a) helping sustain the change, (b) evaluating the effort, and (c) inspiring people to keep renewing and transforming. While efforts are being made to support change, it still must be evaluated according to an established plan. Top leaders must still foster constructive feedback and evaluate processes, consequences, and lessons learned—always keeping the future in mind. If formative evaluations have been made to get ongoing feedback as events develop (Ashely, 2009) and used to modify overall strategies, this phase would be more positive and rewarding. A follow-through evaluation is also suggested to see if continuous improvements are being made in the organization with its people, strategy, process, and structure, and if further changes are possible. Specific changes may come to a certain conclusion, but organizational change is constant and must continue.              Remember  Organization Development (OD) is a change effort that is carried out in a       participative way, involving those affected by the change, and that uses      action research as a key roadmap for the change OD approach that has      been widely and successfully used in many ways to get \"change that      lasts.\" That is the key benefit of OD.                                                                                                                  PAGE 12","Remember  OD Effectiveness ModelTM is a simplified representation of the general      steps in initiating and carrying out a change process. Managers and OD     practitioners, when demonstrating the competencies of an OD     practitioner, are well-advised to rely on the OD Effectiveness model as a     compass to show them the direction in which to lead the change effort     and change process.
